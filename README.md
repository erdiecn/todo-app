# todo-app
An application I designed and built the front-end. I know that todo apps are a pretty common tutorial to build but I built this with my job at UT. We wanted to give students and professor a way to communicate what they have to do for a class through Canvas LMS. Students have expressed that they are overwhelmed with all of the online classes that they are having to take with Covid-19. We made this app to be simple and effective, so students can feel less overwhelmed by their studies.
